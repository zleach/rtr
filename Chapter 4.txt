In the quiet mundanity of her home, Emily grapples with the profound and disquieting offer of sanctioned retribution for her sister's untimely fate, as a voice on the other end of a phone call—a government official named James—guides her through the cold, calculated steps of legal vengeance. Each word from James weighs heavily in the air, like a stone in water, rippling through Emily’s moral landscape, challenging her conception of justice and her thirst for closure. His voice, tinged with a sorrowful understanding, paints a picture of a society that walks the razor's edge between righteousness and retribution, leaving Emily to balance on the precipice of a decision that is at once repellent and seductive, the power to end a life as tangible and as distant as the smooth, cold granite beneath her fingertips.
