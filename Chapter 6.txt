In the simmering heat of personal vendetta and legal consequence, Emily Jernigan steps through the imposing doors of the state's administrative offices to confront an unfathomable choice. Confronted by the faces of loss echoing from sidewalk shrines, and the harrowing cries of protesters denouncing her potential actions, she must navigate the paper-thin line between justice and vengeance. As she submits her application for the right to exact retribution, a chance encounter with James, a clerk bearing his own scars from the system, forces Emily to question the weight of her decision and the true cost of peace. Bound by the cold bureaucracy of a system that both empowers and revolts, Emily is left grappling with the shadows cast by an irrevocable step towards retributionâ€”one that could bring closure or cast her deeper into the abyss of moral ambiguity.
