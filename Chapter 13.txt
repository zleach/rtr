After the friends stumble into a merry stupor, their lighthearted return home is jarringly upended by an act of malicious intimidation, transforming the sanctuary of their home into a chilling tableau of threat. With emotions running high and alliances tested, Emily must navigate the murky waters of fear, betrayal, and the harsh realities of standing up for justice, all while a sinister force seeks to silence her fight. The stakes are raised, and the message is clear: the truth might not be as safe as it seems.
