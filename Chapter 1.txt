In the heart of Texas, where the echoes of frontier justice still resonate beneath the vast, azure sky, Emily Jernigan grapples with a power that is as formidable as it is unsettlingâ€”the newly sanctified American right to exact legally sanctioned retribution. As an English teacher, she bears the burden of educating youth on the stark ramifications of such a law, while in the privacy of her own life, she is ensnared in the labyrinth of a moral quandary, where the lines of vengeance and justice blur. Through a landscape punctuated by the unyielding thrum of high school academia, the intimacy of marriage, and the spectral silence of a childhood wrought with memories, Emily navigates a path strewn with the gravitas of choice, the weight of untold secrets, and the plaintive yearning for a peace that seems as elusive as the whispering prairie winds.
